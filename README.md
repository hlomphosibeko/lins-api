# Lobola Insurance

Lobola is traditional Southern African custom in which a man pays a bride price--usually in the form of cattle or money--to the family of the woman he wishes to marry. It is practiced in several cultures. This site hopes to help many people from going into debt or borrowing money to pay lobola. Insurance helps reduce the financial risk and provides peace of mind during a culturally important but expensive process. The site is mainly targeting people who wish to marry and yet can't afford. The site does not only offer insurance, but also a platform where members can share content of their Lobola events, other members can read, and comment on the content shared. This insurance app is not only targeted at South Africans, but the world as it keeps diversing. There are people who go into multiracial marriages, due to traveling a lot. So when people learn about customs and cultures of South Africa, then they will find this insurance app useful.
