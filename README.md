# Lobola Insurance

Lobola is traditional SouthernAfrican custom in which a man pays a bride price--usually in the form of cattle or money--to the family of the woman he wishes to marry. It is practiced in several cultures, including amoung the Zulu, Xhosa, Tswana, and Shona people. This site hopes to help many young men from going into debt or borrowing money to pay lobola. Insurance helps reduce the financial risk and provides peace of mind during a culturally important but expensive process. The site is mainly targeting young men who wish to marry and yet can't afford. The site does not only offer insurance, but also a platform where members can share content of their Lobola events, other members can read, and comment on the content shared.
